# HabitTracker

Excited to showcase my latest project—a habit-tracking app that helps users build positive routines and monitor their progress daily. The app allows users to set goals, view streaks, and stay on track with reminders, all wrapped in a user-friendly interface inspired by Duolingo’s “Streak” calendar.

Key Features:

    •    Customizable habit creation with frequency options (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
    •    Real-time progress tracking with streak count and a visual calendar view for completed habits
    •    Reminders via notifications to keep users motivated

Tech Stack:

    •    SwiftUI: For building a clean, interactive, and responsive user interface
    •    CoreData & SwiftData: For persistent local data storage of user habits
    •    UserNotifications: For scheduling habit reminders
    •    Combine: To manage data flow and updates across views
    •    MVVM Architecture: To structure the app’s data management and UI updates
    •    SwiftCharts: (optional) for future visual habit progress analytics

This project demonstrates my abilities in iOS development, data persistence, notification handling, and app architecture.
